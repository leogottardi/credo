# Exit Status

Credo fails with an exit status != 0 if it shows any issues.
This enables shell based pipeline workflows (e.g. on CI systems) which test Credo compliance.

## Issue Statuses

The exit status of each check is used to construct a bit map of the types of issues which were encountered by or-ing them together to produce the final result:

```elixir
use Bitwise

issues
|> Enum.map(&(&1.exit_status))
|> Enum.reduce(0, &(&1 ||| &2))
```

This way you can reason about the encountered issues right from the exit status.

Default values for the checks are based on their category:

    consistency:          1
    design:               2
    readability:          4
    refactor:             8
    warning:              16

Let's see what this means using an example:

```bash
$ mix credo

[...snip...]

$ echo $?
12
```

So an exit status of `12` tells you that you have only Readability Issues (`4`) and Refactoring Opportunities (`8`), but e.g. no Warnings.

Naturally, custom checks and plugins can provide their own exit statuses.

```bash
<custom category>:    32
<custom category>:    64
```

## Actual & Custom Errors

To also allow for actual errors, an exit status of `>= 128` signals something went wrong during analysis itself.

These status codes do not follow the bitwise notation described above:

```bash
Generic Credo error:  128
Credo Config errors:  129-131
Reserved errors:      132-191
```

Naturally, plugins can provide their own exit statuses.

```bash
<custom errors>:      192-255
```
